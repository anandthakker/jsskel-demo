# A quick demo

To run, clone this repo, and then:

```
npm install
npm start
```

If you have `budo` and `installify` installed globally, you can skip the `npm install`.


## Hack!

Hack on `index.js`.  With the server running, the `installify` transform will
automatically `npm install` any modules you require, saving them as dependencies
in `package.json`.
